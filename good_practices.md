### Some tips

- code for contract if needed

- encapsulate what changes more

- composition is better then inheritance

- keep same granularity and have naming , style and convention consistent

- have well defined boundaries over components / packages

- Software architecture does not age gracefully. Choose your battles (for maintenance)

- don't suprise other devs with unexpected behavior and don't update function parameters' contents

- respect namespacing

- Convention over Configuration over Code

- Env vars over Files over Hard coded (default)

## About flexibility and complexity

- rigid vs flexible

- easy vs hard

- simple vs complex
