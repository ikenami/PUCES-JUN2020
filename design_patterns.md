## About patterns

First of all, what is a pattern? Recurrent solutions for recurrent problems

### Object oriented programming

- Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritance

- Coupled classes, god classes, huge inheritance chains, tangled code, hyper fine grained O.O.P.

## Most known O.O.P design patterns

- creational, structural and behavioral

- and others more than that

- why use patterns?

- pros and cons

- anemic vs rich models

- stateful vs stateless

### creational

Hides complexity, 
expose specific boundaries, 
hides configuration to improve simplicity when using some code / function,
reuse expensive or scarce resources

### structural

Ways to glue your code pieces reusing already known approaches,
ways to organize you code to avoid some caveats

### behavioral

Well known solutions for recurrent problems (skeleton algorithm)
